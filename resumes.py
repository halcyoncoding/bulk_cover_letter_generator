OLD COVER LETTER
I have an honours B.Sc. in chemistry from York University, that includes upper-level studies in analytical, organic, and inorganic chemistry. This has given me a solid foundation in the theoretical aspects relevant to these disciplines as well as laboratory experience with the associated technologies and testing procedures. 
Senior level studies in social and experimental psychology have helped me understand the logic underpinning research design. A fourth-year social psychology project involved designing a research experiment and proposing an appropriate form of statistical analysis for the data the experiment would generate. I can critically evaluate research in this field and provide feedback on the appropriate application of research methodologies and statistical methodologies.
Courses in biochemistry, abnormal psychology, experimental research design and organic chemistry have familiarized me with the concepts and terminology used in psychiatric literature. The design of research studies and the use of statistics in their interpretation, overlaps with those used in psychology. Similarly, the concepts and terminology relevant to food science are largely dealt with in analytical and organic chemistry.

and suppliers. This experience has equipped me to effectively coordinate with
the diverse stakeholders involved in Metrolinx projects.
In developing software to enhance data collection from music aggregators in my
position at Telus International., I demonstrated my capability to optimize
procedures and exceed management’s expectations, resulting in my promotion
to an auditing position where I analyze my colleagues work. These skills will be
invaluable in managing Rail Maintenance instructions and operating procedures
at Cad Rail.
I am keen to bring my skillset and collaborative approach to Cad Rail Industries
Ltd. I look forward to the possibility of discussing this exciting opportunity with
you. Thank you for considering my application.

I am writing to express my interest in the Quality Control Laboratory Analytical Chemist II position. I have an Honors Bachelor of Science in Chemistry from York University with an emphasis in analytical and inorganic chemistry. Three years of in-class analytical chemistry laboratory training has honed a skill-set which aligns well with the requirements of this position.
I have qualitative and quantitative analyses experience using 1H and 13C NMR, UV-VIS, TLC, FT-IR, HPLC, AAS, among other analytical techniques, and am familiar with GMP regulations and the ISO 17025 laboratory standard. While I have never used a LIMS, I am familiar with their general functionality, and am able to quickly gain proficiency in novel software applications.
My advanced training in 1 & 2-D NMR, GC, and HPLC theory, and the interpretation of associated spectra has equipped me with the skills to investigate the causes of OOS spectra, and make appropriate adjustments to the associated analytical procedures.
I have a knack for spotting inefficiencies, and devising creative ways to increase productivity, without compromising quality. At my current job with TELUS Int., I developed a small software program that increases the efficiency of data collection which is relevant to determining the popularity of music media. I also made it possible to obtain Spotify data pertaining to a song’s popularity in Canadian cities with a single click, allowing for a more accurate assessment of media popularity, at about 1.3 x the speed. I can’t stand doing something the “traditional” way, when I think there’s a more efficient way to do it without compromising quality, it torments me.
As a detail-oriented individual with excellent communication skills and strong problem-solving ability, I am confident in my ability to perform and assist with sample analysis, and analytical investigations, as well as my ability to optimize the efficiency and costs of laboratory operations.
I would be honored to bring my skill set and talents to this QC position, and contribute to the ongoing success of Teva Pharmaceuticals. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss my candidacy for this position with you.

I am writing to express my sincere interest in the Unilingual Investigator Analyst position recently advertised on the Government of Ontario job board. I have a  BSc (Hons) in chemistry from York University, and am confident that my training has honed the analytical, problem-solving, and organizational skills imperative to making balanced, well-reasoned decisions regarding the suitability of Ontario Immigrant Nominee Program candidates for PR nomination.
Organic Chemistry requires careful analysis of competing electronic, structural, and environmental variables to accurately predict chemical reactions in the synthesis of organic compounds, and to correctly analyse experimental results. The analytical and problem-solving skills which this involves are relevant to those required to conduct a comprehensive comparative analyses of OINP applications. A keen interest in current events and Canada’s economic outlook will allow me to make well-informed decisions about the impact of current issues on the labour market, with respect to a candidate’s viability.  
I have excellent writing and organizational skills, which have been necessary to navigate the weekly demands of a post-secondary chemistry program. These demands included writing a weekly minimum of two, 10-15 page scientific (lab) reports, which demonstrates that I have the ability to consistently produce high- quality, detail-oriented reports, and would be able to meet or exceed monthly productivity targets. 
An important skill I have developed, is the ability to determine when a piece, or certain pieces of information are at odds with an expected outcome.  This ability is required to determine when an element of an applicant’s file, or claims they have made, are inconsistent with other pieces of information on file, and warrant further investigation.
I appreciate the importance of the OINP to Ontario’s future success. If given the opportunity to serve as an Investigating Analyst, I would do my utmost to ensure that the candidates who were best aligned with the OINP’s standards, and best situated for long term success, given forecasted labour conditions, were selected for PR nomination.  I feel that my training, skillset, and sincere interest in Ontario’s long term well-being, uniquely positions me to accomplish this task.
